# Standard DEX Scaffold

This repository provides a basic template for building a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain. When you finish the steps outlined in this guide, you will have:

- Setup a fully functioning DEX (or "Nova Relayer") on your local server
- Leveraged Nova Protocol smart contracts on Ethereum to securely exchange tokens
- Performed some trades on your DEX
- Learned how to customize your DEX: change fees, add markets, etc.

It should take less than 10 minutes to get your DEX running.
